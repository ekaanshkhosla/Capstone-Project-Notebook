Problem
We all know that there are many Indians in California, but there are very few Indian restaurants. So decided to open an Indian restaurant & Bar in California.

Description of Data 
I have used data from Kaggle to find the most suitable place to open up an Indian restaurant and Bar in California. 
Data for longitude and latitude values of California:

By exploring California I found that, Los Angeles has mostly Non-Indian restaurants and less Bars. So I decided to explore Los Angeles in order to know where a Non-Indian restaurant & Bar should be open. I again used Kaggle to get the longitude and Latitude values of various places in Los Angeles.
